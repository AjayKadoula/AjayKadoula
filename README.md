### Welcome  ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! 

I am ###Ajay Kadoula, pursuing Mtech in Computer Science & Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad. I am a Full Stack Developer.

I am largely self-taught and have focused heavily on online resources as well as hands-on implementation to pursue my dream of becoming a successful Software Engineer. I have recently completed my summer internship as a Web developer at Famore Solution Pvt Ltd, and currently I am developing React Native based Bus Routes assistance App with Kabchefs. We are developing a MongoDb based single buses routes time plateform for all states roadways and private buses.

My domain of interests includes Competitive Programming, Object-Oriented Designing, Full stack development, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. Apart from this, I like to spend my free time in participating in Competitive Programming contests at CodeChefs, solving problems on Hackerrank and Leetcode, watch movies & TV-Series.
